Setup: After replacing the api_key and the password, one can access the program.
The program itself takes in user input of a location and returns the weather of the location with a funny script
 of length 150-300 words.

Hardest part: The hardest part of the program was being able to make succesive calls to both APIs, the
weather stack API and OpenAI API. However, by mapping out the process logically I was able to fix my problem.
